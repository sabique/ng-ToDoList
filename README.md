# Functionality
* Add a task
* Delete a task
* Clear all tasks

# How it Works
I have used the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to save and fetch all the data.

A user can add any number of the tasks in the list and they can also delete them.

# What I Used
* Angular 7
* HTML5/CSS3
* Firebase
